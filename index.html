    <h4>Turtles</h4>
    <p>Stuff about turtles and stuff about the things related to turtles, a quick light hearted play on words about turtle shells, then a long winded explanation about a unique type of turtle that goes on and on. Eventually when the topic derails into someone's personal life and the solitude of some kinds of turtles this ends in a sign off referencing teenage mutant ninja turtles.</p>

    <h4>Cheetahs</h4>
    <p>Cheetahs are the fastest cat known to man OR woman OR whichever gender pronouns make you more comfortable. Not trying to make anyone feel awkward or anything about their identity. Anyway.... cheetahs! Did you know a Cheetah is the guy who makes Cheetos, I think? Chester, I think. Chester Cheetos. Yeah! That's his name. MAN. I LOVE CHEETOS!!!</p>

    <h4>Toads</h4>
    <p> Toads are pretty chill tbh. I don't know much about them. Toadstools are a mushroom, though... maybe they have something to do with toads? MAN I could REALLY go for some dang CHEETOHS right now!!! What was I talking about? Mushrooms or something? </p>
